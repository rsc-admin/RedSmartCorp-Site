# RedSmart Website

This is a simple one-page website for RedSmart Consultants. To deploy:

1. Push these files to a GitHub repository.
2. Go to [Cloudflare Pages](https://pages.cloudflare.com/), create a new project.
3. Connect your GitHub repo and follow the steps to deploy a static site.
4. Set your domain (e.g., redsmartcorp.com) in the project settings.

That's it!
